  ### U.S. water withdrawals, 1950-present

  How and where Americans use water has changed with our population growth and many technological, environmental, 
  and regulatory drivers. 
  The USGS Water Availability and Use Program has documented how and where we use water for the last 65 years. 
  Above, state size (area) is scaled proportionate to total state water use and water use by category. 
  National water use for each year and by category are shown as bars above the timeline. Drag the timeline 
  to see data for available years, click on total or specific water-use categories, then mouse over the States 
  and the bars for water use values in million gallons of water per day (Mgal/d).
  One million gallons of water covers a football field in about 2.8 feet of water. 
  
  Every 5 years since 1950, the USGS has compiled and estimated water-use information in cooperation with State, 
  Federal, and local agencies to document how the Nation's water resources are used. Prior to 1960, Industrial and Thermoelectric 
  water use categories were not assessed individually. Data at the site, county, 
  and major watershed levels are available for some years, but not for the full period of record. Compilation of water-use data for 2015 is underway. 
  This information is essential to accurately understand how future water demands will be met while maintaining 
  adequate water quality and quantities for human and ecosystem needs. The USGS Water Availability and Use Program hopes to move toward even higher spatial resolution 
  and more frequent reports in the future.

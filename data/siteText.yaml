title: "### How much water do we use? U.S. water withdrawals, 1950-present"

introText: |
  The USGS Water-Use Information Program has documented how and 
  where we use water for the last 65 years. State water use is shown by the size (area) 
  of each state. National water use for years it was estimated is shown as bars above the 
  timeline. Drag the timeline to see data for available years, and mouse over states and bars 
  to see water use values. The values shown are in million gallons per day (mgd). As a reference, 
  a million gallons of water would cover a football field about 2.8 feet deep.

  How and where Americans use water has changed with our population growth and many technological, 
  environmental, and regulatory drivers. In this figure, the area and color of each state polygon 
  show the amount of water withdrawn in that state, either in total for the four categories shown
  (blue) or broken out by use category. Mouse over the legend to see maps for specific water use 
  categories, and slide the time bar left or right to see different years.

  Every 5 years since 1950, the USGS has compiled and estimated water-use information in cooperation with State, 
  Federal, and local agencies to document how the Nation's water resources are used in the year preceding the 
  comilation. This information is essential to accurately understand how future water demands will be met while 
  maintaining adequate water quality and quantities for human and ecosystem needs. This figure shows state-level 
  data, but data at the site, county, and major watershed levels have also been collected variously over the years. 
  The USGS Water Availability and Use Science Program hopes to move toward even higher spatial resolution and more
  frequent reports in the future.

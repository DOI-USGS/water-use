title: "### How much water do we use? U.S. water withdrawals, 1950-present"

introText: |
  The USGS National Water-Use Science Project has documented how and 
  where we use water for the last 65 years. Below, total state water use, 
  and water use by category, is represented by the size (area) of each state. 
  National water use for each year and by category are shown as bars above the timeline. 
  Drag the timeline to see data for available years, and mouse over states and bars above 
  timeline for water use values.

explanationText: |
  How and where Americans use water has changed with our population growth and many technological, 
  environmental, and regulatory drivers. In this figure, the area and color of each state polygon 
  show the amount of water withdrawn in that state, either in total (blue) or by use category. 
  Mouse over the legend to see maps for specific water use categories, and slide the time bar left 
  or right to see different years.

  Every 5 years since 1950, the USGS compiles and estimates water-use information in cooperation with State, 
  Federal, and local agencies to document how the Nation's water resources are used. Water use data has been 
  collected and compiled by the USGS since 1950 in five year increments. This information is essential to accurately 
  understand how future water demands will be met while maintaining adequate water quality and quantities for human 
  and ecosystem needs. This figure shows state-level data, but data at the site, county, and major watershed levels 
  are also being collected wherever possible. The USGS Water Availability and Use Program hopes to move toward even 
  higher spatial resolution and more frequent reports in the future.

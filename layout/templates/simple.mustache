      <p>How and where Americans use water has changed with our population growth and many technological, environmental, and regulatory drivers. In this figure, the area and color of each state polygon show the amount of water withdrawn in that state, either in total (green) or by use category (other colors). Mouse over the legend to see maps for specific water use categories, and slide the time bar left or right to see different years. Every 5 years since 1950, the USGS compiles and estimates water-use information in cooperation with State, Federal, and local agencies to document how the Nationâ€™s water resources are used. Water use data has been collected and compiled by the USGS since 1950 in five year increments. This information is essential to accurately understand how future water demands will be met while maintaining adequate water quality and quantities for human and ecosystem needs. This figure shows state-level data, but data at the site, county, and major watershed levels are also being collected wherever possible. The Water-Use Program hopes to move toward even higher spatial resolution and more frequent reports in the future.</p>

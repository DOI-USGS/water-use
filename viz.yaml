  description: >-
    Water use data has been collected and compiled by the USGS since 1950.  This data has
    changed over time in terms of how it was categorized and at what spatial scale it was
    summarized to.  This visualization shows that change over time as this dataset has become
    more powerful, and attempts to illustrate where the data can go in the future to be a more
    useful dataset going forward.
